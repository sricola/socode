*Welcome to soCode, the social coding experiment.*

**Four steps, fork -> edit -> open a pull -> merge**

## Rules! ##
- Add a function with your github name as its name.
- Your function can do anything and everything, as long as it finishes in a reasonable amount of time. No infinite loops, please.
- Once your function is written, you can call it from anywhere else in the already existing execution chain.
- Never entirely delete anyone else's function. Edit it if needed.
- `lafin()` should be the last executing function, always
- a call to `lafin()` must remain in `__main__()`.

**Let's see if we can make something meaningful out of this.**
