Welcome to soCode, the social coding experiment.

Four steps, fork -> edit -> open a pull -> merge

Here are the rules!
      - Add a function with your github name as its name.
      - Your function can do anything and everything, as long as it
        finishes in a reasonable amount of time. No infinite loops, please.
      - Once your function is written, you can call it from anywhere else in the 
        already existing execution chain.
      - Never entirely delete anyone else's function. Edit it if needed.
      - lefin() should be the last executing function, always

Let's see if we can make something meaningful out of this.
